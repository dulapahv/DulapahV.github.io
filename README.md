# [dulapahv.dev](https://dulapahv.dev/)

## This is my personal website. It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, and TailwindCSS. It is hosted on GitHub Pages

### Go to [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/dulapahv/dulapahv.github.io/tree/gh-pages) branch to see the deployment code

This website is actually the second version of the website ([old website](https://github.com/.../main/old_website/old_website_3_Stable))

This project makes me much more familiar with HTML, CSS, JS, ReactJS. Furthermore, I am learning to incorporate TailwindCSS, Sass, and Typescript into my website development.
